# mention for GPU in virtual environment configurations you need to setup symbolic links
# like the following.  This removes need to set the  LD_LIBRARY_PATH as we were doing
# first command should create links to all nvidia so shared libraries in the /opt/base/lib/*/tensorflow
# directory
# NOTE: both of these were having problems on tensorflow 2.21.  These basically work to
# add symbolic links into the /opt/base/lib/python*/site-packages/tensorflow directory, but I find that
# I still need to add that directory to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so the above solution to just set the
# library path in the bashrc is currently the cleaner way to go
#pushd $(dirname $(python -c 'print(__import__("tensorflow").__file__)'))
#ln -svf ../nvidia/*/lib*/*.so* .
#ln -svf ../nvidia/*/*/lib*/*.so* .
#popd

# then a symbolic link to the ptxas executable in the virtual environment bin
# directory, which may or may not really be needed in our assignment/project cases
#ln -sf $(find $(dirname $(dirname $(python -c "import nvidia.cuda_nvcc; print(nvidia.cuda_nvcc.__file__)"))/*/bin/) -name ptxas -print -quit) $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/ptxas

# the following are referenced in the Tensorflow documentation as simple ways to verify Tensorflow cpu and

# verify tensorflow cpu setup works

# verify tensorflow detects gpu device
#python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
